# ddCookie_CompanionFunc
Works alongside my deobbed dd script at https://github.com/luminousyinyang/datadome-deobfuscation-script

* the companion func is in "cookieGen.go", basically just copied over the funcs from the deobbed script which are for the jsData and mouseEvents params that change.
* returns the cookie whenever func called to help with all requests on a dd site.
* currently the func is formatted for footlocker. Must change site key to use on other dd sites
